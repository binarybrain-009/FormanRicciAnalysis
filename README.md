# FormanRicciAnalysis

This repository provides a Python implementation for computing and visualizing Forman-Ricci curvature on a directed, weighted graph. Using the NetworkX library, this project analyzes edge-level properties of a graph to understand its local geometric and structural properties.

## Features
- Constructs a weighted, directed graph with predefined nodes and edges.
- Calculates Forman-Ricci curvature for each edge using the formula:

  \[
F(e) = w_e * [ (w(v1) / w_e) - SUM( w(v1) / sqrt(w_e * w(e_i)) for e_i incoming to v1) ]
       + w_e * [ (w(v2) / w_e) - SUM( w(v2) / sqrt(w_e * w(e_o)) for e_o outgoing from v2) ]
  \]

  Where:
  - **w_e**: Weight of the edge.
  - **w_{v_1}** and **w_{v_2}**: Weights of the source and target nodes of the edge.
  - **e_{i, v_1}**: Incoming edges to the source node.
  - **e_{o, v_2}**: Outgoing edges from the target node.

- Visualizes the graph with curvature values annotated on each edge.
- Offers a custom node layout for improved clarity in visualization.

## Example Graph Visualization
Below is an example of the graph generated by the script, with Forman-Ricci curvature values displayed on the edges.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/FormanRicciAnalysis.git
   cd FormanRicciAnalysis
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install networkx matplotlib
   ```
4. The output graph will be displayed, showing the Forman-Ricci curvature values for each edge.

## Applications
- **Network Analysis:** Identify dense clusters and sparse regions in the graph.
- **Edge-Level Insights:** Understand bridge edges and local connectivity.
- **Visualization:** Provide graphical representations of curvature for research and analysis.
